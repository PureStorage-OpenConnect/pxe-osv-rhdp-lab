== Scenario - Persistent Storage Volume Provisioning and Availability for Virtual Machines

In this scenario, we will learn about how to provision a virtual machine
on OpenShift Virtualization with Pure Storage.

== Step 1 - Deploy a virtual machine using the OpenShift command line tool

Let's start by building a VM using the `oc` command line tool.

=== Task 1: Generate an SSH keypair

In order to interact with our virtual machine, let's create an SSH keypair.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
----

=== Task 2: Create an OpenShift Secret with our SSH key:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: authorized-keys
  namespace: vmtest
data:
  key: $(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | base64 -w0)
EOF
----

=== Task 3: Create an OpenShift Virtual Machine

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: centos-stream9-example
  namespace: vmtest
spec:
  dataVolumeTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: centos-stream9-example-ds-centos-stream9
      annotations:
        cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.usePopulator: "false"
    spec:
      sourceRef:
        kind: DataSource
        name: centos-stream9
        namespace: openshift-virtualization-os-images
      storage:
        resources: {}
  instancetype:
    name: u1.medium
  preference:
    name: centos.stream9
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices: {}
        resources: {}
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 180
      volumes:
      - name: centos-stream9-example-ds-centos-stream9
        dataVolume:
          name: centos-stream9-example-ds-centos-stream9
      - name: cloudinitdisk
        cloudInitNoCloud:
          userData: |-
            #cloud-config
            user: cloud-user
      accessCredentials:
      - sshPublicKey:
          propagationMethod:
            noCloud: {}
          source:
            secret:
              secretName: authorized-keys
EOF
----

The above command created a VM called `centos-stream9-example` that we will use for the rest of the labs.

We can check the status of the VM running this command.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
watch oc get vms
----

Once the VM is running, ctrl-c to exit.  We can then log into this VM using this command (if you do so make sure to exit again by pressing `Ctrl-D` or typing `exit` and pressing `Enter`):

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example \
  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
----

== Step 2 - Deploy a Virtual Machine using the OpenShift Console

Start by logging in to the OpenShift console if you haven't already.

=== Task 1: Create a new VM

Navigate to the Virtualzation > Virtual Machines menu

image:create-vm-11.png[Select VMs]

Select our `vmtest` project in the upper left of the interface

image:create-vm-12.png[Select Project]

Click the `Create` button, and then select `From instanceType` from the menu

image:create-vm-13.png[Click Button]

Select the CentOS Stream image. We can also use the default instance
type.

Verify that our StorageClass is set to `px-csi-vm` and click
`Create VirtualMachine`

This will automatically start the virtual machine after a short
provisioning process.

====
[NOTE]
It can take a few minutes for the VM to boot for the first time
====

Explore the tabs for this virtual machine. We can view metrics,
configure snapshots, and view the YAML configuration.

====
[NOTE]
The Virtual Machine name will be different in your environment

Click `Next` to move on to the next lab.
