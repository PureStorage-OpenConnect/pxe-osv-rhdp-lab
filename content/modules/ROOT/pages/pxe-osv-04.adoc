== Scenario - Virtual Machine snapshots with Portworx

In this scerario, we will create a virtual machine snapshot.

We have created a new virtual machine that we will be using for this
excercise.

== Virtual Machine Snapshots

=== Task 1: Create a VolumeSnapshotClass

In order to take snapshots, we need to configure a VolumeSnapshotClass.

Run the following from our terminal tab:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: px-csi-snapclass
  annotations:
    snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
driver: pxd.portworx.com
deletionPolicy: Delete
parameters:
  csi.openstorage.org/snapshot-type: local
EOF
----

=== Task 2: Take a snapshot of our new VM

Log in to the OpenShift Console.

Click on the `Virtualization` menu item, followed by `VirtualMachines`.
We can then find the virtual machine we will be using for this snapshot.

Click on the VM labeled `centos-stream9-example`.

Navigate to the `Snapshots` tab and select `Take Snapshot`

We can accept the default and select `Save`

====
[NOTE]
You will see a warning that our `cloudinitdisk` will not be
included in this snapshot. The `cloudinitdisk` is only used to configure
our virtual machine and provide customizations. We can safely ignore
this warning.
====

=== Task 3: Make a change to our VM

Let's switch back to the command line. To make a change, we are simply
going to make a change to our running virtual machine.

Let's "accidently" delete an important file:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -c 'sudo rm /etc/fstab'
----

Oh no! `/etc/fstab` is an important file for the operation of our linux system.
We can verify that the file is indeed missing by running:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -c 'cat /etc/fstab'
----

Let's fix our VM

=== Task 4: Restore our snapshot

Let's log back in to the Openshift Console.

Click on the `Virtualization` menu item, followed by `VirtualMachines`.
We can then find the virtual machine we will be using for this snapshot.

Click on the VM labeled `centos-stream9-example`.

image:snapshot-vm-01.png[Select VM]

Click on the `Actions` menu, and select `Stop`

This will stop our running VM so that we can restore our snapshot.

Click on the `Snapshots` tab. Then click on the kebab menu by the
snapshot we created earlier and click
`Restore VirtualMachine from snapshot`

====
[NOTE]
Restoring a snapshot is a distructive operation as it
discards all changes that were made to a virtual machine since the
snapshot was taken. To avoid loosing data, it is possible to take a
snapshot before restoring our virtual machine.
====

Confirm the restore by clicking the `Restore` button.

We can now start our virtual machine by clicking on the `Action` menu
and clicking `Start`

We can check on the progress of our virtual machine’s boot by clicking
on the `Console` or `Overview` tab.

=== Task 5: Verify our restore

After a couple of minutes, our VM should be running. Let’s verify that
our fstab file is back in place:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -c 'cat /etc/fstab'
----

We can now see that the contents of the `/etc/fstab` file has been restored!
