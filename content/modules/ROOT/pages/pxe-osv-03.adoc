== Scenario - Persistent Storage Volume Provisioning and Availability for Virtual Machines

In this scenario, we will learn about how to provision a virtual machine
on OpenShift Virtualization with Portworx.

== Step 1 - Modify our VM

Let's modify our VM to help prove that our changes are retained during a live migration and HA event.

Let's write some data to a file:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example \
  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
  -c 'echo "Red Hat was here" > ~/text'
----

We can read our file at any time by running:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example \
  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
  -c 'cat ~/text'
----

== Step 2 - Test Live Migrations

In order for live migrations to be supported, OpenShift VirtualMachines
need to use a PVC with a ReadWriteMany access mode. We can verify this
by running:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pvc
----

=== Task 1: Live Migrate a VM

Back in the OpenShift Console, click on the `Overview` tab and take note
of the node that our VM is running on.

image:livemigrate-vm-01.png[get ocp node]

We can now migrate the VM to a new node by selecting the `Actions` menu,
and then clicking `Migrate`

image:livemigrate-vm-02.png[migrate vm]

After a few moments the interface will update with the new node.

It is important to understand that in OpenShift Virtualization
VirtualMachines run inside pods. This migration spawned a new pod, on
the destination node, and then live migrated the VM to that pod.

We can view the running pods by executing:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -o wide
----

Notice that one of our pods is in the `Completed` state, this is because
our virtual machine process is no longer in that pod!

We can view the running VMs by typing:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get vms
----

Let's check to make sure our data is still there:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example \
  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
  -c 'cat ~/text'
----

== Step 3 - Providing HA

=== Task 1: Proving HA

We will now induce a failure in our OpenShift cluster.

It is important to understand that in OpenShift Virtualization,
VirtualMachines run inside pods. As we learned above, our virtual
machine is actually running from inside a pod. Let's find out which node
our virtual machine is running on:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
NODENAME=$(oc get pods -o wide | grep 'Running' | awk '{print $7}' | head -n 1)

echo "Your VM is running on node: ${NODENAME}"
----

Let's cause a reboot of this node. We will now debug the node:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc debug node/$NODENAME
----

====
[NOTE]
Running `oc debug node/$NODENAME` can take a few seconds as a pod needs to be attached to the node.
====

Chroot to the host

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
chroot /host
----

And finally, reboot the OpenShift worker node hosting the running
MongoDB pod:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
reboot
----

====
[WARNING]
It is possible that your `showroom` lab interface (where you are reading these instructions) happens to be running on the node that you just rebooted. In that case the terminal on the right will disconnect. You will need to refresh your window until OpenShift notices that the node is down and re-schedules the showroom pod to an available node.

To speed up the re-creation of the pod you can also find the showroom pod in the showroom namespace and delete the currently running pod.
====

Let's watch our VM and pod status in the default namespace:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
watch oc get pods,vms -o wide
----

Take note of the NODE column. We will see a new launcher pod start on a
new node.

We can verify that our virtual machine is again running in the OpenShift
Console, but because this was an unplanned outage, the VM has rebooted.

Let's check to make sure our data is still there:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
virtctl ssh cloud-user@centos-stream9-example \
  -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -t "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
  -c 'cat ~/text'
----

You are ready to move to the next lab.
